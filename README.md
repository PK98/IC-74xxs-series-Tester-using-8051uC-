# IC-74xxs-series-Tester-using-8051uC-
Following is a code in embedded C for an IC ( 74xx series) Tester 

Its divided into several different parts like keyboard and LCD which were later amalgamated together in the final code.

This code can be extended to any 8 pin IC whose gate function is known. I have developed one for the 74xx series which include AND,OR,NOT etc gates.
